# Sports.Net
A project created to learn and better understand C# and .NET 6

An online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page, a shopping cart 
where users can add and remove products, and a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details. 
I will also create an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for 
managing the catalog, and I will protect it so that only logged-in administrators can make changes
